# mlb_data
Tools to gather data from the MLB website and load it into a SQL database.

The jupyter notebook and python utility functions in mlb_data_utils.py will gather data from the MLB website and load them into three tables in a SQL database. Connecting to the database depends on the code in the db_utils directory.

The SQL files will build some useful views.
